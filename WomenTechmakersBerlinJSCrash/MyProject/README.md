# Homework for week 2

1) Create a node.js project by running `npm init`
2) Split your classes from last week's homework into different files. *Export* them as *modules* and *require* them in your `index.js`
3) Search npmjs.com for a library that could fit to your project.
4) Install that library to your project using `npm install` and `require` that library in your code.
5) Using the `database.js` module introduced this week, save one or more of your classes into JSON files.
6) DO NOT SUBMIT `node_modules` folder. `package.json` is sufficient.
